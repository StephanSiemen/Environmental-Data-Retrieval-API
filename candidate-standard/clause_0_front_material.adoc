== Introduction

[big]*i.     Abstract*

The Environmental Data Retrieval (EDR) Application Programming Interface (API) provides a family of lightweight query interfaces to access Environmental Data resources by requesting data at a *Position*, within an *Area* or along a *Trajectory*. An Environmental Data resource is a collection of spatiotemporal data that can be sampled using the EDR query patterns. These patterns are described in the <<rc_core-section,Requirement Class Core>> section. 

EDR API query patterns, such as Position, Area, Cube, Trajectory or Corridor, can be thought of as discrete sampling geometries, conceptually consistent with the feature of interest in the https://www.ogc.org/standards/sos[Sensor Observation Service (SOS)]. A typical EDR data resource is a multidimensional dataset that possibly could be accessed via the http://www.ogc.org/standards/wcs[Web Coverage Service (WCS)]. In contrast to SOS and WCS, EDR implements the technical baseline of the OGC API family of standards and aims to provide a simple-to-use, single set of user-centric query patterns. EDR use cases range from location-centric real or virtual observation retrievals, including time-series, to sub-setting 4-dimensional data cubes along user-supplied sampling geometries. These query patterns do not attempt to satisfy the full scope of either SOS or WCS, but provide useful building blocks to allow the composition of APIs that satisfy a wide range of geospatial data use cases.

The OGC has extended their suite of standards to include Resource Oriented Architectures and Web Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). These standards are based on a shared foundation, the OGC API-Common standard, which defines the resources and access paths that are supported by all OGC APIs. These are listed in <<common-paths>>. This document extends that foundation to define the Environmental Data Retrieval API. 

The resources identified in  <<common-paths>> primarily support Discovery operations. Discovery operations allow clients to interrogate the API to determine its capabilities and obtain information (metadata) about a distribution of a resource. This includes the API definition of the server(s) as well as metadata about the resources provided by those servers.

This standard extends the common query operations of all OGC APIs by defining simple, coordinate-based, queries which should be applicable to many geospatial resource types. Other OGC API standards may define additional query capabilities specific to their resource type. EDR Query operations allow resources or values to be retrieved from the underlying geospatial resource data store. The information returned is based upon the selection criteria (query string) provided by the client.
